                                               SQUADGOO : MODERN WORKPLACE
Logo and its files: please follow the link: SquadGoo.zip

Squad Goo pty ltd is working on develping website and mobile application related to the industry of Labour hire market in modern way possible. We wanna be a software match making company which would be handled by our newly developed software between three types of users essentially : 
Jobseekers: By the name of it, these are users who are actively looking for jobs, contracts and short terms roles. There are two types of job seekers: Those who works as legal employee of any business who we refer as TFN( Tax file number) employee and those who view themselves as a contractor/freelancers  who we refer as ABN (Australian business number ) contractors. TFN users often gets salary directly from their employer with reduced taxes while they receive the payment of work. Organisations needs to follow employment laws and regulations while hiring these type of job seekers. 

On the other hand ABN workers view every job as a contract and operate as independent small personal business. These type of users usually send invoices to clients and demand the amount and taxes are handled by ABN worker themselves. 

Recruiters (job providers):By the name of it, These are the users who are hiring particularly for their business  or companies. We have catagorised recruiters in two sections:
Business Owner: Those accounts which are handled by the owner/director of a company is known as owner account. Owner usually use their account with us for hiring purposes and they will have access to multiple (REPRESENTATIVE) accounts that are created under same company kyc or Linked to the owners accounts. There can only be one owner account (Main account ) per businesses/Companies.
Business representatives: These accounts are managed and under the controls of main account (Business owners) and also used for same purpose of hiring or finding matched staff or contractors for their business. Each new business representative accounts have to be approved by main account (owner accounts) by sharing the referrence number while signing up. If referrence number of Business owner account number is provided during signup then, representative accounts needs to wait for business owner account’s notification where a code is generated which the representative account must input to activate their account immeidately. However, who ever is creating new representative accounts needs to go through kyc verification of the user who will be in control of this account.

                       Representative also have option to sign up traditional way if they do not provide the referrence of owner account which means they will again verify their kyc and kyb of the business they are linked with. Once kyc are verified then representative can operate this account however, this types are accounts are sub accounts or in full control of ADMIN accounts / Business owner accounts.
and 
 Individuals (general public): These are catagorised as user base who are nither a job seekers nor a recruiters but are general public who will use our services for finding sub contractors to help them per task. For example, If an individual RAKESH is looking for helpers to help moving their houses, cleanning their house, plumbing services and so on that is not linked with commercial chores. Bases on the need of individuals, they will click on “find a contractor” on their account logged in and fill the details and fill the form, they will be given an options to choose: Mannual and Quick (REFERRENCE TO :              FOR MORE UNDERSTANDING).
           After kyc is verified, user have option to mention their gig/jobs they want help with including expected salary and other factors they need to fill then job seeker (only abn worker/contractors) will be able to view and accepts the jobs. There is no hourly amount set for these type of gigs, rather works based on project scope. Payments are being handled by our platform or they may choose to handle the payment outside out platforms. 
These is a platform who kind of famous in this section , please check their website and mobile application for more understanding : referrence of how individual accounts are used for : https://www.airtasker.com/au/ 

IMPORTANT NOTES :
There are three type of users using our platform : Jobseekers, recruiters and individuals.
These are two types of match making : Mannual and Quick search.
There are two type of job seekers: ABN and Tfn

—------------------------------------------QUICK SEARCH AND MANNUAL SEARCH—----------------


Match making are happening in two ways : QUICK SEARCH AND MANNUAL SEARCH.
QUICK SEARCH : For recuiters and individuals, quick search options will generate them matched profile in percentage basis by matching the requirement from hirer side to the information already available in hires profile. Not only that, but if User have enabled system matching, then our platform will auto send offers directly to matched profile and start the process of getting the job seekers at their work location. Users mainly select these option, because it will save them some time and job seeker can be expected to arrive at their worklocation immediately. Those business who wants someone to help them out immediately at their worklocation within few hours or within a day mainly find this tool helpful. 
Howver, the recruiters and individuals still have control power to dismiss the offer sent by our system before another jobseeker accepts it. Hirer can cancel the offers and keep on sending offers to their liked profiles as long as it is within our cancellation policy and does not exceed the number of jobseekers they were looking for initially. Quick search comprise of System/hirer sending job offers to job seekers, Job seeker accepting it within timeframe or the system might send the offer to other available matches. 

quick search is also very different form manual search releated to the scope of it. once a job seekeekers accepts quick jobs , the jobseeker has optional to either accept it or decline it. Accepting the job offer, will connect both parties this includes features such as:
LOCATION SHARING: Once job seeker accepts the offer, the jobseeker will be given certain timeframe depending upon the job start time, for example 30 min to be ready and head towards the worklocation. First step is accepting the job offer, second is preparing themselves to go to workplace, third is location sharing and live progress view where recruiter will be able to view job seekers location after they are about 5 km away from their home location. This will work similarly to an online food delivery softwares like uber eats. Fouth stage is when job seeker arrives within 5 km of the workplace (Notification is being sent to recruiter in real time notifying them of jobsekkers status of the progress). Fifth stage is when jobseeker arrives at workplace. After arriving at workplace, the location sharing will stop assuming that process has completed. 6 th and 7 th stages are optional (Requesting our platform to handle the payment from our plaftorm.

i. 6 th stage: Once job seeker arrives at recruiter’s registered workplace, Both jobseekers and recruiter has options either to handle the payment from our platform or directly between them. IF any of the parties wants our in app or in platform payment method, then one of the party will submit the request. This request button will be available in “Active job offer” section of both users or will be asked at the end of stage 5. In order to activate this stage 6, once request to handle the payment from our platform is selected, both user will be generated QR code or code generated on their notification. For example, lets say RAKESH arrived at the recruiter’s work location, now RAKESH click on “Arrived at workplace” then select option of “request in platform payment”. Since RAKESH requested , the current recruiter will be generated codes or qr code into their side through in app notification, which needs to be to shared with RAKESH, this gives our platform confirmation that our platform will be handing the payment. 

ii. 7th stage: Once 6 th stage is complete and verified from both users with code or qr code scanning or sharing, Timer can be start, based on the hourly rate preagreed, our platform will keep on holding the SG COINS ( native currency) from recruiter Wallet . In case the recruiter has low balance, recruiter will need to recharge or the jobseeker will be notified about the lack of balance prior to 1 hours of actual balance cease. Job seeker can either choose to continue which will not make our platform liable for any dispute in future or choose to discontinue or leave the workplace once the balance low notification arrives. 
Furthermore, While in stage 6, job seeker will be notified prior about balance requirement from recruiter side to complete this job. For example: If rakesh wants to start in app payment method, rakesh is confirming or editing details about pay rate, time of starting/time of finishing for that day. While codes are being generated on recruiter side, once code are shared with Rakesh which is vital to know both parties agrees. During code generation, Recruiter will be notified of any edits or preagreed pay rates and timing of jobs. Sharing the codes enables both parties to come to agreement. Based on this agreement, our platform wants to hold the balance of coins required to complete this agreement. IF recruiter has less balance then actual balance needed to complete this task, Jobseeker will be shown warning message that the balance in recruiter side is low and only cover certain hours for this role on that day. Job seeker then decides one more time , either to ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONTINUE ANY WAY or DECLINE or REQUEST OTHER PARTY TO RECHARGE.

ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONTINUE ANY WAY: This means, jobseeker understand that recruiter has low balance and our platform wont be liable in case recruiter do not want to recharge or unpay for extra hours, then its jobseekers responsibility to handle payment after balance in recuiter account finishes.  After this , the timer clock will show up in jobseeker side, Jobseeker can start the clock at any time, once clock has started, the balance available in recruiter wallet keep on going on hold. 
DECLINE: This means, job seeker wont be able to get timer clock and choose to decline the job and return from the workplace. Since this decline took place at recruiter’s workplace, our platform will no longer be liable for the payment of this role.
REQUEST OTHER PARTY TO RECHARGE: This is the method to negotiate with the recruiter regarding recharging their account. Recruiter has 5-10 minute timeframe to recharge and have balance of full task available in their wallet or esle job seeker will be notified of failed attempt, then jobseeker have same two option either A OR B.

                                   Above 6 th and 7 th stages are vital and proper designing and flaw model should be in place. USERS specially the party who is expected to receive the payment can choose in QUICK SEARCH SETTING where they can pre select, setting that will avoid these type of delays at workplaces. For example, if RAKESH has preselected in QUICK SEARCH SETTING and checked the box that says”
“ONLY RECEIVE QUICK JOBS WHERE RECRUITER HAVE ENOUGH BALANCE PRIOR TO SENDING JOB OFFER” then only the quick jobs offer by the recruiter who have SG COIN available in their wallet to be able to pay. 
Similarly other setting includes :
“ALL PAYMENT RELATED TO QUICK JOBS WILL BE HANDLED BY SQUADGOO PLATFORMS” Which means, RAKESH is going to receive quick job offers from recruiter who also agrees to handle payment from SQUADGOO platform while creating the offer.



CHAT CONNECTION ENABLED: Once a match making takes place and offers are given and accepted by another party mainly job seekers, then only Both parties will be able to chat , video call, voice call or share documents using our in app build chat options. Both users will be able to freely chat with each other but this features will be disabled after 30 days. Chat and transcripts will be saved in our system for security purposes is any dispute or complaints arises in future and permanently deleted from our system after 12 month of chat expired date. To chat again with same users after 30 days of starting the match, recuiter needs to re send the offer and be accepted  by the both same parties gives them another 30 days and continues chat from same point where it was disableded before.
CONTACT DETAILS REVEALED: Before jobseeker accepts a job offer, both parties were unable to view key credentials of each other that would facilitate to contact with each other this includes their mobile number, email address and so on. However, after match making is executed then both parties contact details are revealed to both parties for the next 30 days of match making date after which new match making is to be executed;
IN APP/PLATFORM PAYMENT REQUEST: As explained before : Based on the preselected criteria of both parties, or agreement set out before job seeker starts the paid works in recruiter’s workpalce, SQUAD GOO will facilitate SG COINS transferring from recruiter’s wallet to jobseekers wallet after Clock stops.

To explain in more details : for example, lets say RAKESH reviewd the job offer once again and proceeds to request payment from platform ( only in the case where pre setting was not selected) in step 6 of the process, Recruiter will be given code along with the details verified or edited by the job seeker (RAKESH) , Recruiter accepts the details of agreement or ask RAKESH to make change before codes could be shared. Once both parties find agreeement details are correct, recruiter should share the codes to rakesh that gives rakesh option to start the clock. Once rakesh clicks on START THE CLOCK, recruiter will also receive the notification that the clock has been started. Both users have option to stop the clock. However, if recruiter wants to STOP THE CLOCK before the cesation of early agreed hours on that day , recruiter needs to input the code generated from job seeker side. Once stop the clock is clicked from recruiter side, RAKESH  is notified of the attempt of clock stop and reveiw and confim the clock stop, then code gets generated which will be relaid to recruiter then clock stops even if the agreed hours for that day was more than stopped clock hours.

But if jobseeker (RAKESH) wants to STOP THE CLOCK prior to the finishing of preagreed hours, no codes agreement are necessary and recruiter is notified.

However, in a scenario where pre setting was selected for our platfrom to handle the payment, on both sides, these process will be rather quick for example:

RAKESH preselected in QUICK JOBS SETTING that:
i. All jobs payment to be handled by SQUADGOO
ii. ONLY RECEIVE OFFER FROM JOB PROVIDERS WHO PREAGREED TO LET SQUADGOO HANDLE THE PAYMENT
In such setting, RAKESH do not have to worry about payment and only receives the offer from job providers who have pre balance available to cover the cost of the job total timing according to the payrate. And since Rakesh selected i. No prior code sharing at stage 6 needed, rakesh can start the clock immediately or at anytime after arriving at recruiters work place. STOP THE CLOCK will work simialry as explained before for both parites only if they STOP THE CLOCK BEFORE THE ACTUAL STOPPING TIME PER PRIOR AGREEMENT. Clock will auto stops after pre agreed, (as per job offer) come to stop. Both users have now option to either :
RESUME THE CLOCK: In a scenario where clocks auto stopped after the actual agreed time expired or clock was stopped before the agreed time with both parties code sharing, BOth user have now 1 hours to RESUME THE CLOCK again….. This means if recruiter wants to start the clock at any time after clock is stopped following our above conditions, recruiter do not need codes from job seeker. They may select RESUME CLOCK, unilaterally that will start our system to register the hours again .Recruiter has option during clock resume, to re select or edit the term such as pay rate and expected end time of the job, however, if edit happens then code is necessary from job seeker to ge shared before resuming. However, if recruiter starts the clock unilaterally without changing key details from prior agreed agreement before first clock was started then no code sharing needed, recruiter can unilaterally start the clock again. But to stops the clock again, recruiter would need code sharing from job seeker to stop the clock. 

                                     Now lets assume that job seeker wants to initiate a STOP THE CLOCK feature , then this situation; no codes are needed from recruiter to stop the clock if clock stops before recent agreed agreement when the clock was started. However, to resume the CLOCK again then job seeker preview the agreement again or request change then wait for code to be shared from recruiter to RESUME THE CLOCK. 
                                     
                                  If clocks are not resume within 1 hours then the job will be conisdered completed and the SG COINS of equivalent hours registered by the system will be deposited immediately to the job seekers wallet, however any earned SG COINS remains on hold for 7 days before they can use or withdraw it. This gives both parties up to 7 days to complaint or report any misconduct.  If no report comes then SG COINS gets available for use or withdraw in job seekers account. 
                            Multiple RESUME THE CLOCK AND START THE CLOCK can be executed by both parties following the conditions we have set above. If conditions are not met, the started clock only stops when the job stop timing stops of recent agreeed clock start. BOth parties have controls to change the prior agreed condition after clock has stopped but must be code sharing depend on who initiated the clock stop or resume. 
JOB COMPLETE:  Once a clock stops with both parties agreement or once clock auto stops after the job timing expires, rathe then resuming the clock, any party can initiate JOB COMPLETE BUTTON that will complete and whole job and each parties will be notified. After job complete is selected by job seeker:
i. Send invoice now: Once job is completed, if it was pre seleted in the job offer that the jobseeker needs to provide invoices, then the system will send invoices to recruiter once job seeker click on the SEND INVOICE NOW!. However, if job seeker fails to send the invoice then, system will auto generate the invoice to recruiter after 7 days if requested unilaterally from recruiter later going through Completed or expired job offer MENU. 

However, in a scenerio where, payment were not handled by the platform, then this will provide file upload option for job seeker to upload their invoices which gets delivered to the recruiter. Or in recruiter initiate then, request will be sent to the job seeker to upload their invoices to deliver to the recruiter. 

But this is only applicable to ABN/Contractors job seeker, since only contractors send invoices once jobs are completed.
ii. Request payment proof : Jobseeker can click this option on the spot or later going through the COMPLETED JOBS menu, to generate or request payment advices. If payment was handled by our platform then, our system will generate them payment transaction proof and if payment was handled outside of our platform then request will be sent to recruiter, then recruiter will upload their own payment proof.  

PAYMENT PROF REQUEST MAY BE : PAYSLIPS, PAYMENT MADE PROOFS AND RECEIPTS. THIS is ideal for both TFN/ABN JOBSEEKER.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: SQUADGOO WILL NOT PROVIDE IN PLATFORM PAYMENT FUNCTION TO TFN(EMPLOYEE) Since, squadgoo is not their employer nor follows employment law. 

MANNUAL SEARCH: As the name suggest, this is for mannual hiring and cost almost half than quick search charges. This is purely a match making function, and finishes its performance once a match is made: once job offer is sent, and accepted. There will be no more function beyond that in comparision to quick jobs/search.
            
           Step 1, is recruiter clicks on mannual search, fill the details corresponding to available pool of job seeker. IF job seeker selected on their setting and enabled “GET MANNUAL JOBS” then only job seeker starts getting mannual offers. System will show matched profiles in recruiter side after details are input. Matched profile will be shown in percentage basis out of 100%  to show each profile matched percentage. Recruiter can go through their profiles, and surf through jobseekers profile. They wont be able to view each other contact details and chat funcation just yet, but enough information will be shown that is related to job such as their experience, year of birth, suburb they live in , educational qualifications and so on .

Step 2,  Recruiter click on Send the mannual offer, this will send mannual offer to job seeker profile, Based on the job offer expiry time input by the recruiter initially, now the job seeker have that much time to respond to the job offer. 

Step 3: Jobseeker view the job offer: Jobseeker will not read all the details about the job they are being offered and decides to take actions :
i. Accept the offer: By accepting the offer, job seeker accepts the job and match making is complete. Both users contact details now becomes available for both users and chat functions gets enabled. Similar to QUICK MATCH, chat and contact information will be disabled after 30 days of initial match making.  Once offer is accepted by the job seeker, job seeker will be notified to change their availability to ensure that future job offer keeps on coming but not overlapping current offer’s availability that was already accepted. Accepted job offer will be shown in COMPLETED JOB OFFER section, which they can change to Close the offer at any time if they wish to again remain active for the next offer. Job seeker needs to explain or select the option available to close the offer which will be sent to the recruiter. 
ii. Decline the offer: Once job seeker decides to decline the job offer, then recruiter will be notified and recuriter can keep on sending job offer to other profiles, since no match making took place; no one is charged. However, if the profile match was above 70% and still the jobseeker decided to decline the offer, then they have to provide the reason why they are declining the offer. Reasons are auto provided based on common selection or they can click on OTHER REASON and write their own, This decline reasons are transmitted to recruiter.  

If the reason provided by the job seeker is not of satisfactory, then our admin review team, will decide either impact the acceptance rating of the jobseeker or not. SOme time our system will auto reduce the ACCEPTANCE RATING of job seeker profile if selected reasons are not eligible for unaffected decline. ACCEPTANCE RATING is the rating out of 100% based on the total job offer received , total offers accepted/closed, total offers declined and other factorys such as negative reviews and compliants if found satisfactory ground to reduce the acceptance rating. 

Those job seeker with less acceptance rating have low chances of getting job offers in future even if they have high match percentage. It is vital that our system carry match making reading acceptance rating of certain profile along with their profile matching percentage.  

Acceptance rating of a job seeker profile is visble to any recruiter while surfing their profile.
iii. Request modifidation: REQUIRE MODIFICATION request if sent by the job seeker, then recruiter will receive the notification to modify the job offer. Once REQUIRE MODIFICATION is selected, job seeker has ability to change the conditions and details of the job offers such as :
PAY RATE
TERMS OF WORK
JOB DESCRIPTION
HOURS PER DAY
AND OTHERS.

This request is sent to recruiter to respond, if recruiter wants to ACCEPT THE MODIFICATION then match making happens and treated as ACCEPTED OFFER. However, if recruiter declines the modification, then it will be treated as Declined job offer from job seeker side. 

squadgoo pty ltd will not provide in platform payment services , live tracking, clock setting for mannual job offers/search and expect both parties to discuss and agree themselves .

FAQ

                        PROFILE TYPE - RECRUITER:
Recruiter is not two types but is the same profiles of the same company or businesses. Businesses and companies who are hiring for their workplaces are called recruiters. NOw in general there are two types of profiles in a recruiter; One is main accounts and another is sub accounts or we call it representative profile. There can only be only one main account per kyc, however, if the main profile wants to create subaccounts and wants to give those accounts to their staff or hiring team then they can also do so.  Sub-accounts will have different email addresses and passwords and are totally not linked with main accounts. If the sub account’s user is the root user, then we do not even need to verify their kyc again in sub accounts. However, if there is another user, then the additional user also has to go through our kyc but not the kyb. Lets explore the recruiter profile type: 
MAIN PROFILE:  This is the root user profile and follows the same login , sign up and account creation process explained above. Simply, Main profiles now can create sub profiles with different or same profiles. All sub profiles access and logins are available here
REPRESENTATIVE PROFILE:  This is the subaccount and follows the main profile's decision to create a sub account. 
—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

—--------------- INDIVIDUAL- SIGNUP/REGISTRATION—----------------------------------------------------
Registration of individual users is similar to initial registration of other user type. They will provide their names, contact details and agree to terms and conditions. 

                             INDIVIDUAL- MAIN PROFILE MENU

REPORTS AND STATICS: Similar to recruiter
ACCOUNTS SETTING: Similar upgrade and accounts setting as recruiter.




INDIVIDUAL USERS- FUNCTION AND PLATFORM USES
INDIVIDUALS are not official businesses and they are more referred to domestic related industries. Similar to airtasker, a user can request for any profile matches to help in their chores. We will view airtasker and improvise our business model in individual functions. FOr example, Rakesh if an individual is looking for a removalist who can help him move the house. Rakesh will first sign up, and verify his details. Later he can go to the Labour Pool and start browsing contractors or he can use our FIND A CONTRACTOR function and fill in the details of what he would like help in and his budget. Once an offer is made, depending on quick or manual, individuals will be charged for matches once the offer is accepted. 
 Please note that individuals might seem very similar to recruiters however, they are not. Recruiters were supposed to input correct and factual details about their matches however, since individual projects offerings are more general and needs discussion with the match profile, THe contractor (jobseeker) needs to communicate or provide feedback on the offer. 

IF a job seeker has enabled himself in getting offers from individuals accounts the only individual offers are made to that user. Also if Rakesh selected 50$ for the entire project and surfing through the profiles ( in manual search) and sends an offer to a contractor he thinks appropriate, rakesh is going to see all the details related to job and if he accepts then he gets the deal or he can also click on ASK TO MODIFY option which will give him power to request the offer owner to change either scope, budget and other factors which needs to be accepted by the individuals before match making can happen. On the other hand individuals have the option either to accept the modification or decline the modification. If they decline the modification then the offer is closed for job seekers. 

On the other hand, going through a quick search will send the offer by our system to multiple job seekers simultaneously around the host locations. Multiple accounts can accept or request modifications, The individuals can now choose whose modification to accept or whose bid to accept. 

Also the profile of job seekers is going to show very differently in comparison to recruiters. Recruiters were able to see professional experiences however, for individuals, they will be able to see only gigs and previous accepted individual offers worked in the past as experience. THey will be able to see their bio, skills and so on. Which means professional experience is not necessary and invalid for individuals in this case.  

Also the amount of SG coins we charge for recruiters and individuals are going to be different as well. For individuals, We will charge them 2% of the total offer budget for manual search but not more than 10 SG COIN cap . And for quick , 5% of the total offer budget but not more than 15 SG COINS. For example, if Rakesh is looking to find a contractor that he wants them to help him in his house painting role of budget 500$(500 SG COINS) then rakesh will be liable to pay 2% of 500 SG coins which is 10 SG coins for manual found matches which is also the cap of the manual search max charge. But for instance if  the budget was for 1500 SG coin (aka 1500aud) then 2% is 30 SG coins however, since our cap is 10SG coins, users will pay us only 10 SG coins. Similarly it goes simultaneously with quick offers.

Also the timer (start and stop clock) is not necessary for this user and its functions since there are no hourly offers, all the offers are expected to be project wise. 


—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKETPLACE-DEFAULT—---------------------------------------------------------------

The marketplace we are trying to build is more related to local areas similar to facebook market places. Here users will be able to sell or buy used or new goods and rotate around the community. For better references, please check out facebook market place to understand the functions.
Please note: All transactions and pricing only works in sg coins, the same wallet of the user is able to spend or receive the payment during marketplace transactions.

There are two types of users in marketplace: 
BUYER: Those users who are willing to purchase items from our marketplace are known as buyers. These users must have available SG coins in their wallet in order to purchase anything. 
SELLER/MERCHANT: Those users who are willing to sell items in our marketplace are known as sellers or we may refer to them as merchants. Any one can be a seller and buyer according to their needs. Sellers are expected to receive payment from the buyer in their SG COIN wallet and later may withdraw the coin to AUD in their bank account.

FLOW: For example, Rakesh is a buyer and Shehroz is a seller. Shehroz just posted his motorbike for sale at around 5000 SG COINS. Shehroz had to pay no fee to list his items with us. Since shehroz already verified their profile, now shehroz has full access to the marketplace immediately. There is no signup or extra purchase necessary to be a buyer or seller. The only criteria is that both users need to hold at least one of the following accounts(Jobseeker/Recruiter/Individuals) and stay verified before they can access the marketplace in their mobile application. 

Information shehroz needed to fill while posting his motorbike:
Step 1: User goes to marketplace icon
Step 2: Marketplace opens with following menus:
Dashboard: This is where important updates and pending orders and disputes resolution messages are shown.
List now: This menu encourages users to sell their items and list in our marketplace.

For example, If rakesh and shehroz during dealing with motorbike came to an issue then either of the users may go to the dispute resolution menu and select the item number which is in dispute then one of our dispute mediators will assist both of them in the same chat. BOth users are able to chat with mediators in the same chat once this dispute starts. 
                        For more reference, Go to binance customer service dispute center.
                        The mediator has the power to demand proof and evidence from both parties and try to make a fair decision. The mediator may also refund Buyer (hold any equivalent SG coins from Seller and give to buyer as refund) if seller is found to be at fault . Or in other cases, if the buyer is at fault then Mediator can issue a fine that needs to be paid to the seller or dismiss the matter or suspend the account of the buyer if the fine is not paid.

                      We will learn more from how facebook marketplace or gumtree are listing and we will improvise.

STEP 4: Seller submit the listing for review (generally takes few minutes to an hour.
Transaction process: marketplace

Rakesh (buyer) was surfing and selecting what he wanted to buy and he saw a mobile phone on sale. Rakesh goes through the images and descriptions and decides either to initiate the process. 
Step 1: Buyer will be provided 3 options in the listing ad :
Chat with the seller ( this will send a chat request to the seller and once the seller accepts it then both parties can chat with each other). Unlike other chat functions in our platform, this chat is for the long term.
Hold the listing : (Buyer may choose to hold the listing for the buyer after which if seller had 1 item to sell then the list will not be visible to the public). To hold the listing , buyers must have an equivalent amount in their wallet to hold the listing and only can hold for 30 minutes for free. If they want to hold the items again or for more time then the buyer pays a 5SG coin charge per 30 min hold.
Buy the item: Buyer may choose to buy the item or listing directly from the seller. In this situation, equivalent sg coin per listing is on hold and available to the seller once the seller and buyer both confirm the item's status. Once sellers finalise their part then the SG COINS paid by buyer will be available in sellers account but still remains in hold for 7 days before it can be used or withdrawn. This hold of 7 days allows our platforms to monitor fraud and complaints beforehand.
Step 2:  Buyer will pick the item or if seller provides option of delivery, then buyer waits for the items to be delivered to their doors. 
Step 3: Buyer if unable to pick the order or if direct delivery was not provided by seller, then buyer has option to hire delivery/inspection service. Here, buyer will be able to click on ADD DELIVERY/INSPECTION SERVICES (OFFERED BY SQUADGOO) : All jobseekers who have signed up for delivery related roles will receive the delivery request and once accepted, the delivery personnel will be attending the sellers property or workplace to pick the order on behalf of the buyer. Delivery/inspection personnel will coordinate with both parties and provide feedback to the buyer if the buyer is not able to see the listing in real life. The delivery/inspection service fee varies on a number of factors such as distance associated, load of items and arrangements. By clicking ADD DELIVERY/INSPECTION SERVICES(OFFERED BY SQAUDGOO) squadgoo is sending quick offers to jobseekers who are registered with us as SQUAD COURIER. Once a courier service personnel is found, the buyer will be notified and both can communicate and finalise the delivery cost. Once the buyer accepts courier delivery fee, then the cost of the item will be updated with final cost including DELIVERY/INSPECTION SERVICE, Transaction fee and item cost. If buyer do not like any pricing, they may click on Continue finding other courier.
Step 4: Buyer payment will be on hold, buyer goes for pick up ( in case buyer wants to pick up directly), Buyer waits for delivery ( in case seller wants to deliver), Buyer waits for delivery (in case SQUAD COURIER is selected). Lets see further in different circumstances :
Buyer going to pick up the items: Once a deal has been reached, The buyer will make the SG coin available for hold before REQUESTING TO PICKUP or REQUESTING TO INSPECT.:
Requesting to Pickup : Buyer’s total cost SG COINS remains in hold and buyer gets pickup locations from seller in chat. The buyer reaches the seller's property or workplace to pick up.
Requesting to inspect: Buyer can request to inspect the items that are available for sale, but solely depends on the seller's interest. IF the seller agrees, then the buyer needs to make SG coins available to be on hold. Buyer may choose extra services such as SQUAD COURIER to do the inspection of the items if the buyer is unable to inspect themselves.
2. Buyer waiting to get the items delivered by seller : If seller has in house delivery option available then, buyer’s SG coins will be deducted from the wallet, and credited to the seller. These SG coins will be on hold until the buyer receives the package and further 7 more days after delivery. Sellers if using an external delivery method that takes more than 7 days to deliver must inform the buyer in advance. If the delivery takes more than 7 days, then the buyer may place a Dispute resolution center. Once the package reaches the buyer, its sellers responsibility to notify the buyer and platform that ITEM HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED and upload necessary proof that shows the item has been delivered to the property by a third party. If the seller is delivering the items themselves then the buyer needs to click on CONFIRM ITEM RECEIVED which will generate code on the buyer side, which needs to be input by the seller to complete the delivery. Once delivery is confirmed, then after 7 days of delivery, if no dispute arises then the SG COINS to be available for use or withdraw on the seller's side. If the seller was using third parties such as Australian post, then the seller must notify the buyer and provide the tracking number to the buyer on chat. 

3. Buyer waiting to get the items delivered by SG COURIER: If buyer choose squad courier to facilitate inspection of the items or delivery of the items, then buyer’s SG coins will be deducted from Buyer’s wallet and credited to seller once SG COURIER picks the order from the seller’s location. SG COURIER needs to click on ITEM PICKED, Then head towards the buyer and drop at their location and upload a delivery picture. 

Step 5: Buyer receives the item: Once buyer has its items as per their ways to getting it, buyer needs to click on ITEM RECEIVED. If the buyer does not choose to click on ITEM RECEIVED, then the seller may choose to raise the dispute.

HOW WILL SQUAD GOO EARN FROM MARKETPLACE:-
We expect all transactions in the marketplace to take place through our wallet features. Users will buy SG coins in order to recharge their wallet. SquadGoo charges 0.2% of total transaction value from the seller’s SG coin received from the buyer. SG transaction charge should have a cap up to 100$. For example, if Shehroz put up a listing of mobile phones for 500$ (500 SG COINS) then the real price will show as 501 SG coins (including transaction fee). The buyer once pay 500.5 SG coin to the seller and will distribute 500 SG coins to the seller and 1 SG coins to our platform. In the event of a refund to the buyer, then the buyer will receive 500 SG coins but not 1 SG coin.
